# Stalin-Sort
Implementation of a generic stalin sort, an O(n) sorting method. This is usable with any generic type (int, float, double, char, etc). Also with structs.



### Implementation of stalin sort in C:
  Stalin Sort works as follows: 
  ```
  1)Go through the array
  2)if you see an element that is not sorted in the array, eliminate that element..
  3)Continue until further elements go AWOL from your paramount regime, eliminate those as well.
  4)Bask in your O(N) sort time.
```
